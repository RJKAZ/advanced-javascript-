Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns 

Objectives 
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

What is an Algorithm?  = A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task (this can be very simple, or very complex)

Why do I need to know this? 

Almost everything that you do in programming involes some kind of algorithm!
It is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer 

also, this stuff comes up in Interviews...alot

HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?
1. devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns 

Lets start off with Problem Solving Strategies 

Problem Solving 
- Understand the Problem 
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor
