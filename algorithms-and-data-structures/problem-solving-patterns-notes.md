Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns 

Objectives 
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

What is an Algorithm?  = A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task (this can be very simple, or very complex)

Why do I need to know this? 

Almost everything that you do in programming involes some kind of algorithm!
It is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer 

also, this stuff comes up in Interviews...alot

HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?
1. devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns 

Lets start off with Problem Solving Strategies 

Problem Solving 
- Understand the Problem 
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor


Step 1 - Understand the Problem

1. Restate the problem in your own words to make sure you understand what the question is. 
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? 
    - You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay, its still worth considering the question at this early stage. 
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem? (what really matters and what terminology should I use)

Here's an example. Given the question

"Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum."

1. write a function that add two numbers, or implement addition
2. Whole numbers? Floating point numbers? can it only work with two numbers, or can we add three? What if its a really large number, like infinity? (where you add so many zeros Javascript just gives up)
- ints?
- floats?
- what about string for large numbers (like infinity)
3. Same as 2
4. What if someone only passes in one number? then you can't do addition
    In that case, do we add zero, or make it undefined/null?
5.
