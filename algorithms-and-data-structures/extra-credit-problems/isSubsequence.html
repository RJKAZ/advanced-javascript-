        Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string.
        In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing. 

        isSubsequence('hello', 'hello world'); // true
        isSubsequence('sing', 'string'); // true
        isSubsequence('abc', 'abracadabra'); // true
        isSubsequence('abc', 'acb'); // false (order matters)

        Your solution must have one of the following
        Time Complexity - O(N + M)
        Space Complexity - O(1)

        function isSubsequence() {
