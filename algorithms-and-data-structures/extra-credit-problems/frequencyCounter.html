        // Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the saem frequency of digits
        // Your solution must has the following complexities 
        // Time O(N)
        // Sample input
        //  sameFrequency(182, 281) // true
        //  sameFrqeuncy(34, 14) // false 


        // So by Frequency, this is refering two two numbers with the same numbers in it, the same number of time
        // like 182 has 1,8, and 2 all once. 281 is the the same, so that would return true. 

        // So the question is asking to compare the two values (i've named num1 and num2) and determing if they have the same frequency. 

        function sameFrequency(num1, num2){
            // so how we do this, we have to take each number and convert them into a string value and then split them apart. So we use two methods, the toString() method which turns it into a string and the split() method which then splits the string apart into an array. 

            let digits1 = num1.toString().split('');
            let digits2 = num2.toString().split('');
            
            // now we are stipulating that if the length of both of the split digit arrays are not the same length, to return false. 
            if (digits1.length !== digits2.length) {
                return false;
            }
            // now we create two empty objects 
            let obj1 = {};
            let obj2 = {};

            // I don't fully get this code, but what this is doing, returning the arrays into the empty objects, turning them back into numbers and adding the value of the combined numbers. 
            // Since adding the numbers in a same frequency would equal the same value. 
            // So we then take the value of the 1st object and pit it against the value of Object 2, where if they are not equal they equate to false. 



            for (const n of digits1) {
                obj1[n] = (obj1[n] || 0) + 1; 
            }

            for (const n of digits2) {
                obj2[n] = (obj2[n] || 0) + 1; 
            }

            for (const val in obj1) {
                if (!(val in obj2)) {
                    return false 
                }

                    return false 
                }
            }

            return true
